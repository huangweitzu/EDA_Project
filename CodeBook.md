## The original dataset includes the following files:
1. README.txt
2. features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
3. features.txt: List of all features.
4. activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.
5. train/X_train.txt: Training set.
6. train/y_train.txt: Training labels.
7. test/X_test.txt: Test set.
8. test/y_test.txt: Test labels.

## The run_analysis.R file include following steps to generate a tidy dataset:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Groups subjects and activity labels then calculates means of all variables.

## The run_analysis.R file include following variables:
1. subject
2. act_label
3. tBodyAcc_mean()_X
4. tBodyAcc_mean()_Y
5. tBodyAcc_mean()_Z
6. tBodyAcc_std()_X
7. tBodyAcc-std()-Y
8. tBodyAcc-std()-Z
